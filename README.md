# 📚 Book-Data-by-Kakao
This project collects and processes book information (metadata, locations, events, etc.) based on **Kakao book data**.  
By organizing **real-world locations and events that form the background of books**, the data can be used for various purposes such as travel planning, literary analysis, and educational material development.
<br/>

## ✨ Key Features
- 📖 **Book metadata collection**: Crawls book information such as title, author, publisher, and ISBN using the Kakao API  
- 🗺️ **Location and event data structuring**: Links locations and events in novels or literary works to real-world coordinates and descriptions  
- 🗂️ **JSON-formatted data provision**: Provides structured data such as `book_location_event.json`, `book_metadata_kakao.json`  
- 🧾 **Easy notebook execution**: Allows users to review the data collection and processing pipeline via `book_info_crawling.ipynb`
